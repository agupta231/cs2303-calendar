# CS2303 Project 1 - Calendar

This is the code base for my first project for CS2303.

## Summary

This program will calculate and print out a formatted calendar for any valid
year. The validity requirements for any give year is:

* The year must be greater than 1583. This is the year when the Gregorian 
  Calendar was instated, and any year before that is technically incorrect.
* The year is less than the size of an integer. If the year is bigger than the
  size of the integer, than there will be an integer overflow error. However,
  program will still print out the correct year for the overflowed integer.

## Execution Instructions

Life should be as simple as running `gcc -Wall -o PA1 PA1.c` and `./PA1` from
the root directory of the project. Once you run the program, it will ask that
you input a year. Simply type in a year, and you should be greeted with a
calendar for that year!
